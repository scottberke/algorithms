# Linear Search  
**O(n)**
- Simplest search approach:
	1. Start from left most element in array
	2. Compare elements, one by one, with target
	3. If you have a match, return the index
	4. If you donâ€™t have a match, return -1 or False
- Rarely used due to inefficiency
- In the worst case, the element is at the end of the list so we have to search the entire list of n items
- In the best case, the element is first in the array and we search 1 item
