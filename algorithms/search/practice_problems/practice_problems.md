## Practice Problems - Search

### Search in Rotated Array
Q) Given a sorted array of n integers that has been rotated an uknown number of times, write code to find an element in the array. You may assume the array was originally sorted in increasing order.

### Sorted Search, No Size
Q) You are given an array-like data structure `Listy` which lacks a size method.
It does, however, have an `elementAt(i)` method that returns the element at index `i` in O(1) time. If `i` is beyond the bounds of the data structure, it returns -1. (For this reason, the data structure only supports positive integers) Given a `Listy`, which contains sorted, positive integers, find the index at which an element x occurs. If x occurs multiple times, you may return any index.
