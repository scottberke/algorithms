### Big-O
	-> Describes performance or complexity of an algorithm
	-> Always assumes upper limit or max number of iterations

#### O(1)
-> always executes in constant size, regardless of the input size
	->  ex: `x == true` 

#### O(n)
-> performance grows linearly in direct proportion to the size of the input data set

#### O(n^2)
-> performance directly proportional to the square size of input

#### O(2^n)
-> growth doubles with each additional input
	->  Exponential grows -> starts shallow and grows very quickly

#### O(log n)
-> logarithmic growth or iterative halving of data set with each iteration
	->  Doubling the size of an input does little to cause growth after the first iteration
